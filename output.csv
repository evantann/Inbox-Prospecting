Hello Brooke,

I wanted to thank you for taking the time to speak with me during my interview this past Friday. It was great learning more about the position and the team I'd be working with.

I am very excited about the opportunity to work with the Ring Central IT team. Our discussion reinforced my belief that my background aligns with the goals of the company and I think my skills fit the qualifications of this position.

Thank you once again for considering my application. I hope to hear from you soon!

Sincerely,

Evan Tan
