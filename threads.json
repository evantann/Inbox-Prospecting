We will see how God\u2019s grace is magnified in the salvation of a pagan prostitute, who eventually becomes one of the ancestors of our Lord Jesus Christ. \r\n\r\nOur Opening Hymn is 93 God, Our Father, We Adore Thee, Preparatory Hymn is 718 Day by Day, and Offertory Hymn is 111 Glory to the Lamb. \r\n\r\nEnglish Ministry News\r\n\r\n- Congratulations to Ian Witarsa for his public profession of faith in Christ through baptism last weekend.  Please continue to pray for God to heal him, and to give strength to him and his family.  Here is the link to his Baptism Video.  It is unlisted and intended only for the NLBC Church Family:  https://youtu.be/LjkvJWDh69Y\r\n\r\n- We are preparing a special tribute video to honor Pastor Peter and Shemu for their 40 years of ministry here at NLBC.  We are asking if you would like to share a brief testimony on how you first met Pastor Peter and/or Shemu.  Please let me know if you are interested.  \r\n\r\n- Catechism Class: If you are ready to make your public profession of faith in Christ, then please let me know.  We are preparing to teach our Catechism Class for Baptism in our Christmas Service.\r\n\r\n- Our English Ministry is recruiting ushers and liturgists.

Joshua humbles himself before the Commander of the LORD\u2019s Army, takes his orders from the LORD, repeats those orders to the priests and the soldiers, implements the battle plan, and devotes the Canaanite city of Jericho to destruction as his act of worship to the LORD.  Joshua demonstrates his humility before God by his obedience to God\u2019s commands.  And in response, the LORD exalts Joshua.

Our God is the great Shepherd, and we are His sheep.  When we stray away from the fold, He seeks for His lost sheep, and when He finds us, He carries us back into the fold.
