No matter what =\r\nkind of life people had before Christ, they can have a =E2=80=9CNew =\r\nLife=E2=80=9D in Christ!  Hallelujah!  Praise the Lord!  So I ask the =\r\nquestions:  Where does this =E2=80=9CNew Life=E2=80=9D idea come from?  =\r\nAnd what does Jesus have to do with this =E2=80=9CNew Life=E2=80=9D?\r\n\r\nPurpose:  To Explain How the Baptism of Jesus Christ Gives a New =\r\nBeginning for the World\r\n\r\nFour Questions About the New Beginning for the World in the Baptism of =\r\nChrist\r\n\r\n1. Why Does the World Need a New Beginning?\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Acts 3:19-21:  19 Repent, then, and turn to God, so =\r\nthat your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from =\r\nthe Lord, 20 and that He may send the Messiah, who has been appointed =\r\nfor you =E2=80=94 even Jesus. 21 Heaven must receive Him until the time =\r\ncomes for God to restore everything, as He promised long ago through his =\r\nholy prophets.\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Rom. 8:18-21:  18 I consider that our present =\r\nsufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed =\r\nin us. 19 For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children =\r\nof God to be revealed. 20 For the creation was subjected to frustration, =\r\nnot by its own choice, but by the will of the One who subjected it, in =\r\nhope 21 that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to =\r\ndecay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.\r\n=09\r\n=E2=80=A2 Isa. 65:17-19: 17 =E2=80=9CSee, I will create New Heavens and =\r\na New Earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they =\r\ncome to mind. 18 But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, =\r\nfor I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy. 19 I =\r\nwill rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in My people; the sound of =\r\nweeping and of crying will be heard in it no more.\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Isa. 66:22:  =E2=80=9CAs the New Heavens and the New =\r\nEarth that I make will endure before Me,=E2=80=9D declares the LORD, =\r\n=E2=80=9Cso will your name and descendants endure.=E2=80=9D\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Rev. 21:1-5:  Then I saw a New Heaven and a New Earth, =\r\nfor the first Heaven and the first Earth had passed away, and there was =\r\nno longer any sea. 2 I saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, coming down =\r\nout of Heaven from God, prepared as a Bride beautifully dressed for her =\r\nHusband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, =E2=80=9CLook!=\r\n God=E2=80=99s dwelling place is now among the people, and He will dwell =\r\nwith them. They will be His people, and God himself will be with them =\r\nand be their God. 4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will =\r\nbe no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of =\r\nthings has passed away.=E2=80=9D 5 He who was seated on the throne said, =\r\n=E2=80=9CI am making everything new!=E2=80=9D Then He said, =E2=80=9CWrite=\r\n this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.=E2=80=9D\r\n\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 2 Pet. 3:13:  In keeping with His promise we are =\r\nlooking forward to a New Heaven and a New Earth, where righteousness =\r\ndwells.=20\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 2 Cor. 5:17:   Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the =\r\nNew Creation has come:  The old has gone, the new is here!\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Gal. 6:15:  Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision =\r\nmeans anything; what counts is the New Creation.\r\n\r\n2. What is the Significance of the Trinity in Creation and Re-Creation?\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Gen. 1:1-3:  In the beginning God created the heavens =\r\nand the earth. 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over =\r\nthe surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the =\r\nwaters.  3 And God said, =E2=80=9CLet there be light,=E2=80=9D and there =\r\nwas light.\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Gen. 1:26:  Then God said, =E2=80=9CLet us make =\r\nmankind in our image, in our likeness=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Mark 1:10-11:  10 Just as Jesus was coming up out of =\r\nthe water, He saw Heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on =\r\nHim like a dove. 11 And a Voice came from Heaven: =E2=80=9CYou are My =\r\nSon, whom I love; with You I am well pleased.=E2=80=9D\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Matt. 28:19:  Therefore go and make disciples of all =\r\nnations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of =\r\nthe Holy Spirit=E2=80=A6\r\n\r\n3. Why is the Holy Spirit Described like a Dove?\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Gen. 8:1:  But God remembered Noah and all the wild =\r\nanimals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a =\r\nwind [Heb. ruah, or =E2=80=9CSpirit=E2=80=9D] over the earth, and the =\r\nwaters receded.\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Gen. 8:8-12:   Then he [Noah] sent out a dove to see =\r\nif the water had receded from the surface of the ground. 9 But the dove =\r\ncould find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface =\r\nof the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand =\r\nand took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark. 10 He =\r\nwaited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. 11 When =\r\nthe dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly =\r\nplucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the =\r\nearth. 12 He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but =\r\nthis time it did not return to him.\r\n\r\n4. Why does God the Father say that He is Well-Pleased with His Son?\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Gen. 1:31:  God saw all that he had made, and it was =\r\nvery good.\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Gen. 3:17:  Cursed is the ground because of you=E2=80=A6=\r\n\r\n\t=E2=80=A2 Rev. 22:3:  No longer will there be any curse.\r\n\r\nPreach:  Are you tired and weary of this current cursed cosmos?  Have =\r\nyou been burnt by the sin and conflict and crime and war of this wicked =\r\nworld?  Are you fed up with politicians who promise change, while things =\r\nstay the same, or even get worse?  Are you sick of sin and sorrow?  Are =\r\ntired of seeing your loved ones suffer and die?  Are you ready for =\r\nsomething new?  Are you ready for a new life?  Come to Jesus!  He has =\r\nthe power to make you and this entire world new!=\r\n\r\n"

Be nice to your Mo=\r\nms!\r\n\r\nProverbs 31:10-31\r\nA Wife of Noble Character Who Can Find? She Is Worth Far More Than Rubies\r\n\r\nIntro: This past Friday marks the Six Month Anniversary for Jing's and my ma=\r\nrriage. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And we are going to have a baby too! Pl=\r\nease pray for God to give us a healthy and strong baby! Thank you! When I pr=\r\noposed to Jing, I read from this very Scripture before asking her to marry m=\r\ne. And today I want to preach this text to thank God, and to bless my wife, a=\r\nnd to honor all the Christian women here.\r\n\r\nThe Context: Proverbs is addressed to young single men who need both wisdom a=\r\nnd a wife.\r\n\r\nA Wife of Noble Character is a Blessing from God (Prov. 18:22; 12:4a; 19:14)=\r\n\r\n\r\nA Beautiful But Quarrelsome Wife is Hard to Live With (Prov. 11:22; 19:13; 2=\r\n1:9, 19; 25:24; 27:15-16)\r\n\r\nWhat To Look for in a Wife (Prov. 31:10-31; an acrostic poem): There is no d=\r\nescription of a woman's outward physical beauty; instead the focus is on her=\r\n devotion to God and her hard work and her wisdom and her compassion. In oth=\r\ner words, a godly wife is known and admired for her character, not for her l=\r\nooks (1 Sam. 16:7; 1 Pet. 3:3-4).\r\n\r\nShe is a blessing to her husband (vv. 11-12, 23, 28-29, 31).\r\n\r\nShe is a business woman (vv. 13-14, 18, 24).\r\n\r\nShe is a hard worker (vv. 15, 17).\r\n\r\nShe is an investor (v. 16).\r\n\r\nShe is a compassionate and merciful giver (v. 20).\r\n\r\nShe is a planner (v. 25).\r\n\r\nShe is a teacher (v. 26).\r\n\r\nShe is a manager (v. 27).\r\n\r\nShe is a wife and a mother (v. 28).\r\n\r\nShe is a woman who fears God (v. 30).\r\n\r\nShe is a woman who should be praised and emulated (vv. 29, 31).\r\n\r\n\r\n"
