CourseAssist is a LLM-powered course assistant that can answer your questions related to ECS162. Unlike ChatGPT, CourseAssist has been tailored specifically for your course. It is trained on your lecture slides and materials provided by your instructor, enabling it to provide precise, context-aware answers to your questions. From conceptual explanations to step-by-step guidance on challenging problems, CourseAssist is equipped to support your learning journey in ECS162.

We've worked hard to minimize instances of misleading and inaccurate answers by grounding the AI's responses to your specific course content, and the chance of hallucination is much lower than other LLMs like ChatGPT. However, please still use with caution and verify answers from CourseAssist when you're in doubt.

For any questions related to course policies, logistics, and rules, please direct them to your instructor, as CourseAssist cannot make decisions that require human judgement.

As an early-stage prototype, CourseAssist is constantly evolving, and your experience is invaluable to us. Encounter a bug? Have a suggestion? We're all ears! Your feedback is crucial in shaping CourseAssist into the ultimate learning assistant.

====================================================================================================Greetings:

After reviewing all of the applications received during the job posting
period, yours has been selected for further consideration for the Apprentice
Infrastructure Engineer position.

To keep the number of interviews manageable, promising applicants are
first being assigned two practical exercises for evaluation. If you are
still interested in pursuing this position, please submit solutions to
these two problems to me via email by Tuesday 26 Sep 2023 at 5pm (you
can simply reply to this message with your solutions).


Exercise 1:
You are employed by a transportation and logistics company which
conveys cargo from factories located in various countries, to commercial
customers or business entities located elsewhere in the world, using
various modes of transportation. You have been tasked with designing the
database for a new system to track the location and status of the cargo
in your firm's custody.

Create an entity relationship diagram documenting your design (using
UML, Crow's Foot, or Chen notation, as desired), and clearly explain any
assumptions you made.


Exercise 2:
An application is generating log files without bound, slowly filling the
available disk space on the server. The logs have names of the form
web_application-20230901.log, web_application-20230902.log, etc., and
contain entries for many operational events, ranging from user logins to
internal application maintenance processes.

Write a shell script (bash, zsh, tcsh, etc.) which extracts error
messages from the log files, inserts those entries into a database
(conveniently located on the same server) for future reporting, then
deletes the original log files to free up space. Assume the log files
are plain text, and the lines containing error messages include the
string "Error Code xxx", where "xxx" represents a 3 digit numerical
code. Be sure to clearly explain any assumptions you made.


An important note about these positions:

Any hires are contingent upon successfully clearing a criminal background
check investigation by the UCD Police Department. Positions in IET are
considered to be critical in nature, and the final appointment is
contingent upon the successful completion of a background investigation
within 30 days of hire. We reserve the right to end employment should
the results of a background investigation not be successful. In
addition, student employees are required to be physically present on
campus while working, unless an exemption is granted by management.

In a blog post yesterday, I wrote "Coverage will mainly be on the statistics tutorial, but may also include variants of Quiz questions from this past week."

My policy is always to ask questions only on material from the previous week or earlier.  Last Thursday we got to the middle of the unit on confidence intervals.

====================================================================================================Hello Everyone,

Our city and campus community continue to be shaken by violent events
including the fatal attack on Karim Abou Najm - a senior student
majoring in Computer Science
and known to many of you.  There is now understandable fear for
personal safety and that of our loved ones.
We will mourn the deep loss of Karim Abou Najm but first let's make
sure that everyone is safe.

1. Please be vigilant  and follow safety precautions outlined by
university police (see
https://police.ucdavis.edu/education-outreach/safety-tips).

Always be alert to your surroundings.
Try not to travel alone.
Always try to vary your routes to and from work or school.
Be aware of location and situation that will make you vulnerable to
crime, especially in darkness. All the crimes occurred late in the
evening.
Avoid people and situations that make you nervous – Trust Your Instincts!
Stay in well-lighted areas as much as possible.
Walk confidently and at a steady pace, making eye contact with people
when walking.
If you ever feel you or others are in danger, call 911.

2. UC Davis Police Safe Rides program is available to all members of
the UCDavis community (Use UC Davis Police Safe Rides after-hours on
campus by calling
530-754-COPS).

3. I am looking to the College  and Central Administration for
policies and I will pass them along as I  receive them.

Finally, in these difficult times please continue to be kind and
understanding to each other.

I will be monitoring my email closely so let me know if you want to
meet/talk with me.

Take care.

Dear Student:
	
Our records indicate that you enrolled or waitlisted for Spring Quarter 2023 in the following course:
	
	ECS 154A	Computer Architecture
	
You have not satisfied the prerequisite requirement(s) for this course and there is no prerequisite petition on file.  As a result, you have been dropped from this course.
	
Reviewer comments:
	The student has not completed ECS 50 with a passing grade. They need to repeat ECS 50 before taking ECS 154A. 

If you need assistance finding another course to take this term, please contact your advisor.
	
For more information about prerequisite checking, go to https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/registration/schedule/prerequisites.
	
Please contact the instructor of the course if you have questions about the decision to drop you from this course.
	
Sincerely,
Office of the University Registrar


====================================================================================================
Hi, everyone.

You are receiving this message because you are either enrolled or on the waiting list for ECS 132, Spring 2023.

As noted in the course FAQs, this IS a math course, and the math prereqs are vital.  One of those prereqs is linear algebra, and I have a review for you at

https://github.com/matloff/fastLinearAlgebra

Lessons 1-5 is all you will need for this class.

Note that as mentioned yesterday, one of the goals of Quiz 0, which will essentially be a take-home exam due the second week of class, will be to make sure you're ready to USE linear algebra in probability/statistical contexts.

I'm enclosing yesterday's message below.

Norm

**********************************************************************

1.  If you have not already done so, please make sure to read the FAQs for the course,

https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/blob/master/FAQs.md

If you have already read it, please note that I added an item about reading at the end, and that I have clarified the math link a bit.

2.  As explained in the FAQs, we will have weekly quizzes, in-class, using the OMSI tool.  However, THE FIRST QUIZ, Quiz 0, will essentially be take-home.  Note the following:

a.  The purpose of Quiz 0 will be to get you used to OMSI, get up to speed on the R language, and review linear algebra.  See the FAQs for the link to the R tutorial (easy, designed for non-CS people).  I am also preparing a linear algebra tutorial, to be announced soon, but unlike the R case, this is intended as review, not new material.

b.  Quiz 0 will be posted sometime in the next couple of days, to give you a chance to get a head start on the course if you wish.  It will be due sometime in Week 2 of Spring.  We will start running the OMSI server in Week 1.

3.  Our textbook will be a subset of the PDF file at

https://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/ProbStatBook.pdf

We will cover about 60-70% of that material.  I will post the exact trimmed version of this file in the next few days.

Looking forward to working with you.

Norm Matloff

We covered distribution families.  On Tuesday, I will continue with the Poisson family.

I'm concerned, though, that your absence from campus caused you to miss last week's quiz.

Hi, everyone.

You are receiving this message because you are either enrolled or on the waiting list for ECS 132, Spring 2023.  Old messages are enclosed below.

Quiz 0 is now ready, at

https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/blob/master/Quiz0.md

It is due by April 11, but you should start before that.  If you wish, you may start now.

As noted in the instructions, it should be very easy, an A+ for everyone.

Norm

**********************************************************************

As noted in the course FAQs, this IS a math course, and the math prereqs are vital.  One of those prereqs is linear algebra, and I have a review for you at

https://github.com/matloff/fastLinearAlgebra

Lessons 1-5 is all you will need for this class.

Note that as mentioned yesterday, one of the goals of Quiz 0, which will essentially be a take-home exam due the second week of class, will be to make sure you're ready to USE linear algebra in probability/statistical contexts.

I'm enclosing yesterday's message below.

Norm

**********************************************************************

1.  If you have not already done so, please make sure to read the FAQs for the course,

https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/blob/master/FAQs.md

If you have already read it, please note that I added an item about reading at the end, and that I have clarified the math link a bit.

2.  As explained in the FAQs, we will have weekly quizzes, in-class, using the OMSI tool.  However, THE FIRST QUIZ, Quiz 0, will essentially be take-home.  Note the following:

a.  The purpose of Quiz 0 will be to get you used to OMSI, get up to speed on the R language, and review linear algebra.  See the FAQs for the link to the R tutorial (easy, designed for non-CS people).  I am also preparing a linear algebra tutorial, to be announced soon, but unlike the R case, this is intended as review, not new material.

b.  Quiz 0 will be posted sometime in the next couple of days, to give you a chance to get a head start on the course if you wish.  It will be due sometime in Week 2 of Spring.  We will start running the OMSI server in Week 1.

3.  Our textbook will be a subset of the PDF file at

https://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/ProbStatBook.pdf

We will cover about 60-70% of that material.  I will post the exact trimmed version of this file in the next few days.

Looking forward to working with you.

Norm Matloff

Hi, everyone.

You are receiving this message because you are either enrolled or on the waiting list for ECS 132, Spring 2023.

You can read previous messages at

   https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132

Two announcements:

1.  Our textbook is now ready, at

   https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/blob/master/ProbStatBook132S23.pdf

Download it to your laptop computer.  You will need it there for all quizzes other than Quiz 0.  

This version is less than half the size of the full book, which is at

   https://github.com/matloff/probstatbook

We will cover the entirety of this reduced version.

2.  After I posted Quiz 0 yesterday, I added a paragraph regarding use of R libraries that are not in base-R.  Make sure to keep this in mind, to avoid situations in which you fail to get credit on a quiz question even though your code correctly uses certain libraries.

====================================================================================================Hi All,

Kevin (grad student in my group) needs to make a new part for some X-ray 
scattering measurements and doesn't know CAD. I instantly thought 
ChemECAD could save him. Is there someone able to work with him today, 
over the weekend, but has to be done on Monday or else Kevin is in deep 
trouble.

Thanks

====================================================================================================Hi, Evan. 

Unless you have a medical/technical reason, that would not be fair to other students in the class. It’s good that you submitted what you have — your TAs are fairly generous in grading and give partial credit for attempts in the right direction. And remember to start early in the week next time, and come talk to me/TAs/tutors during office hours and we are happy to help you complete the HW.

It's not technical in the sense that a qualified engineer isn't required to explain how to complete the process, but it is technical enough in that it requires instruction from an enthusiast who invests substantial time towards personalizing their keyboard.

====================================================================================================Hi Evan Tan,

Your CourseAssist AI account has been created for ECS 150! 

CourseAssist AI is a LLM-powered course assistant that can answer your questions related to ECS 150. It has knowledge about your lecture slides, as well as any information your instructor provides. You may ask it to explain ideas step-by-step. Since all answers are generated by a LLM, use with caution as LLMs are known to hallucinate and make up facts. If you use CourseAssist for any of your homework assignments, be sure to follow LLM usage policies, if any, set by your instructor. 

Do not use CourseAssist to generate code solutions directly, as it may generate misleading or suboptimal code. Rather, use it as a learning aid and ask it to explain concepts. 

For any questions related to course policies, logistics, and rules, please direct them to your instructor, as CourseAssist only has access to course content like lecture slides/notes and cannot make decisions that require human judgement.

Note that CourseAssist is an early stage prototype and it may have bugs. Let us know if you encounter any issues or have any comments or suggestions. We would love to hear your feedback!

You can now log in to CourseAssist AI https://u40698754.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=eA6md-2Bv0pDNsrLJOfubbEC3U5m0BbzzEfUuqkf4NRtZXI9zkmzAFjuW0WUaWRDUPNW6R_TTa87GMsyhOhEeg1I3re0my2l9TXHrO5aG5ga6QOpV94YtI8jV2rJaJfcbkFi1o1VHNvZXrPsLiH6RSnTj-2Fu11z-2FhplkQCveF45uGU8JgeF7hqtKpohqwbbHGVMHNkX5xDvMNq6kt4YzqkrkZAW0cLDA-2BMjx0EBmo9MvuqWSqJZejMMGYD6jXECJXfGfjqKqBljwmrESIuH-2Fk6voXmnFpg-3D-3D using your email and your temporary password below.

====================================================================================================To UC Davis Academics, students and staff -

As campus prepares for the University of California's COVID-19 vaccine mandate - due to take effect July 15 - all employees and students are required to declare one of the following:

 * I am fully vaccinated
 * I plan to get fully vaccinated
 * I plan to request a medical exemption
 * I plan to request a religious belief exception
 * I never work on campus or around others and do not intend to be vaccinated

Go to the "Surveys" section within Health-e-Messaging, and complete the "COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate," containing the five options listed above. 

This survey form must be completed by July 15, including those who have already verified your vaccine information in the Health-e-Messaging portal. Please note that the submission process for medical exemption and religious belief exception is still being finalized. If you selected either of these options, you will receive more information about the process in the coming weeks.

If you are vaccinated and you wish to authorize the university to confidentially verify this information with the California Immunization Registry, you may do so by completing the "COVID-19 Vaccine Verification Authorization" form in the "Medical Clearances" section of Health-e-Messaging. 

**Please note that UC Davis Health employees have a separate vaccination verification process for access to UCDH facilities. Some employees may be required to verify their vaccine status in both systems. 

Looking for an easy way to get vaccinated on campus? We're looking for volunteers to join our standby list when we have extra doses available. Text "DavisVax" to 888777 for text alerts from UC Davis about our vaccine clinic.

For more information about the UC Davis Vaccine Program, go to campusready.ucdavis.edu/covid-vaccination.

====================================================================================================Greetings everyone,

We are Jiji and Huryoung and we are the Asian Pacific Culture Week
Coordinators (APCW) for the UC Davis Cross Cultural Center. You may have
formerly known this celebration as the Asian Pacific Islander Community Night
Market (APCNM), an annual day-long event consisting of vendors, arts, crafts,
foods, and performances from both students and professional groups.

This year, APCW will be different as we kick off the first week of Asian
Pacific Heritage Month (May 3-8, 2021) with a variety of virtual programs that
will lead up to our main event on May 8, 2021, titled Lockdown Sessions: API
Represent. During this week, our community will share experiences, dive into
passions, and spark connections via discussions surrounding culture, home, and
identity within the Asian Pacific diaspora. We will share the list of programs
for APCW as our week comes closer, so be on the lookout for that.

Lockdown Sessions: API Represent is the Cross Cultural Center’s collaboration
with KDVS 90.3 FM. Here, we will be showcasing different API student talents
and acts via Twitch livestream. We are asking the community for 2-4 minute
video submissions that display any expressive medium that you feel is relevant
to API representation. This includes but is not limited to spoken word,
singing, dancing, videography, DJ sets etc. This is a great opportunity to
highlight amazing API talent and to build community! We are excited to share
space and time with you all during the event. Space is limited, so please sign
up as soon as possible.

The deadline to submit your videos will be on Sunday, April 25th by 11:59 PM
PST.

HOW TO SUBMIT
Sign up on the google form  LOCKDOWN SESSIONS: API Represent!
Submit 2-3 minute video to ucd.apcn@gmail.com
Include Title in Subject line
Name/Pronouns/Year in the email
Any size file as MOV, MP4, or FLV
Fill out Cross Cultural Center Photo Release Form 2020-2021

We look forward to working with you all!
Do not hesitate to contact us via ucd.apcn@gmail.com or our supervisor, Olivia

This email is for all Malaysian Students and also anyone who is interested in
meeting Malaysian Students in Davis.

The Malaysian Student Organization will be holding our Last General Meeting
for the school year!!!
Time: 7pm (10th April, Saturday, Davis time) ; 10am (11th April Sunday,
Malaysian Time)

MYSO was initially created to help provide an environment and a group for
Malaysians who are studying in Davis, so they do not feel alone in the states!
However, as we grew, many non-Malaysians joined as well and we grew to 30+
members!
This might be our last year as a club, so we would love to be able to get all
the Malaysians together and we are also open to others who want to learn about
Malaysian Students in Davis who are interested as well!

In addition, we will also be opening up board positions for the 2021/2022
term! This will be an amazing opportunity to show your abilities and help grow
the club!

If you are interested, please reach out to any of these below as soon as
possible!

====================================================================================================Hello Evan,

Sorry that I didn't respond sooner, but I did not have internet for all 
of Monday.

No, they don't include three academic articles. Those would need to be 
in established journals, and the only ones I see among your references 
are the ones by Keating and Østergaard.

You should cite a PDF using the same format for web pages, since this is 
an online resource.

Finally, I would recommend in the future that you contact the professor 
about assignments before the day they are due, particularly when the 
deadline is known to you since the first day of class.

Regards,

Jeremy Mason

====================================================================================================Evan,
You have a choice of using your AP score or taking MAT 16A, 17A, or 21A. If you were to choose to take our MAT 16A, 17A or 21A then you will need to take the Math Placement Exam. If you choose to use your AP score for those classes, then you do not need to take the Math Placement Exam. Sometimes folks want a nice easy transition to college so taking a refresher course in Calculus helps.


As for chemistry you should speak to their department.

I am glad that you found that you have access to the text and homework.

As I understand it, you need to buy equitable access for all three 
quarters, or buy the same access from Cengage directly.  I gather, 
indirectly from other student comments, that they have slightly lower 
prices for longer access periods.  It is almost certain that you will 
use the same text and OWL homework for 2B and 2C.  Equitable Access for 
those quarters will provide it, but at a renewed cost, as I understand it.

Best regards,

Prof. McCurdy

====================================================================================================You should have already received an informational email regarding the Chemistry Placement Exam. For the purpose of this message, we are letting you know that you have been automatically registered to take the Chemistry Placement Exam.

If you are planning to enroll in general chemistry, all students must earn a qualifying score from the Chemistry Placement Exam. For CHE 2A (General Chemistry), students must earn a score of 24+. For CHE 2AH (Honors General Chemistry), a score of 33+ must be earned. Scores earned from the Chemistry Placement Exam are sent via email within two (2) business days after the exam is taken. More information about our placement requirements and the Chemistry Placement Exam can be found on our website (https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/general-chemistry-series/chemistry-placement-requirements/fall-2019).

The time slot selected for you is based upon your major and the college it is housed. You can take the Chemistry Placement Exam online during this time frame:

     You have automatically been registered for this exam.
     Exam time for students in the College of Engineering
     May 18, 11 AM until May 25, 11 AM

Instructions and a link to the exam are available at http://placement.chem.ucdavis.edu/instructions/.

The email address we have on file for you is: ettan@ucdavis.edu

When prompted for your username or proctor username for the exam, you should enter: ettan

 Your password is your UC Davis student ID number, with no symbols or spaces between the numbers.

If you miss your designated testing session for your college's orientation, you will have to wait until the Fall testing sessions open later in the Summer. For those dates, please reference our website (https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/general-chemistry-series/chemistry-placement-requirements/fall-2019).  You will still be able to register for classes, including CHE 2A if applicable, but you will need to have passed the placement exam with a qualifying score before the first day of Fall Quarter.  We strongly recommend that you contact your major/college advisor to review your incoming study plan. This way, they have a chance to comment and ensure that you are registered for the correct set of classes in the Fall.

How can you prepare for the Chemistry Placement Exam? You are welcome to study on your own by reviewing high-school chemistry concepts. Any "Introduction to Chemistry" text would be good for review. You may also find our Chemistry LibreTexts webpage helpful (https://chem.libretexts.org/).

Hello,

I am an incoming freshman and majoring in chemical engineering. Do I still
have to take the math placement exams even if I got a 5 in AB and assuming
I get one too in BC? Also, do I have to take the chemistry placement exam
since I got a 4 in AP Chemistry?

Thanks,
Evan

====================================================================================================Hey Surabhi, it’s nice to meet you! I am Navjeet, and it’s nice to meet everyone as well! I am open to communicate through discord. I am also open to just texting as well. My phone number is 209-857-6426. It seems like most if not all of us is usually free Friday and Saturday so maybe we can chat through discord on those days. 
====================================================================================================Hey everyone,

Nice to meet you all! I'm Surabhi. I thought that it might be of use
to have a way to communicate outside of Canvas. What would you guys
prefer? My proposal is Discord.

Sincerely,
Surabhi Jain

Your CourseAssist AI account has been enrolled for your ECS162 course! 

You may log in to CourseAssist http://url3866.courseassistai.com/ls/click?upn=u001.mJMY9nyel2O4BYOs2VOr2oGy-2BCiU9ehO5QcoeypScujMRvRoBsSDvvytUQpC69t4u4H9_ewBTq0CYeumSYIbXfGVjfJR5ml7BJAhgSnCW7Gkknp4cL9m8gaBEWX6subuj7twUilEMlk3yR0gafBSNQ3-2FFCIR1T7yj0dEY3vpwtoilf47PQY0p-2FDcM5fAOep4KJfZ9rvTLrev-2F8uDqwkmZyxTl55q63jZVAHhdHuOMJtS1EUq3HHDSWrdlziO9tycPa4800B-2BLAxT0iVzB9GFbfqrkLg-3D-3D using your email and your existing password.

CourseAssist is a LLM-powered course assistant that can answer your questions related to ECS162. Unlike ChatGPT, CourseAssist has been tailored specifically for your course. It is trained on your lecture slides and materials provided by your instructor, enabling it to provide precise, context-aware answers to your questions. From conceptual explanations to step-by-step guidance on challenging problems, CourseAssist is equipped to support your learning journey in ECS162.

We've worked hard to minimize instances of misleading and inaccurate answers by grounding the AI's responses to your specific course content, and the chance of hallucination is much lower than other LLMs like ChatGPT. However, please still use with caution and verify answers from CourseAssist when you're in doubt.

For any questions related to course policies, logistics, and rules, please direct them to your instructor, as CourseAssist cannot make decisions that require human judgement.

As an early-stage prototype, CourseAssist is constantly evolving, and your experience is invaluable to us. Encounter a bug? Have a suggestion? We're all ears! Your feedback is crucial in shaping CourseAssist into the ultimate learning assistant.

Thanks,
The CourseAssist Team

====================================================================================================Greetings:

After reviewing all of the applications received during the job posting
period, yours has been selected for further consideration for the Apprentice
Infrastructure Engineer position.

To keep the number of interviews manageable, promising applicants are
first being assigned two practical exercises for evaluation. If you are
still interested in pursuing this position, please submit solutions to
these two problems to me via email by Tuesday 26 Sep 2023 at 5pm (you
can simply reply to this message with your solutions).


Exercise 1:
You are employed by a transportation and logistics company which
conveys cargo from factories located in various countries, to commercial
customers or business entities located elsewhere in the world, using
various modes of transportation. You have been tasked with designing the
database for a new system to track the location and status of the cargo
in your firm's custody.

Create an entity relationship diagram documenting your design (using
UML, Crow's Foot, or Chen notation, as desired), and clearly explain any
assumptions you made.


Exercise 2:
An application is generating log files without bound, slowly filling the
available disk space on the server. The logs have names of the form
web_application-20230901.log, web_application-20230902.log, etc., and
contain entries for many operational events, ranging from user logins to
internal application maintenance processes.

Write a shell script (bash, zsh, tcsh, etc.) which extracts error
messages from the log files, inserts those entries into a database
(conveniently located on the same server) for future reporting, then
deletes the original log files to free up space. Assume the log files
are plain text, and the lines containing error messages include the
string "Error Code xxx", where "xxx" represents a 3 digit numerical
code. Be sure to clearly explain any assumptions you made.


An important note about these positions:

Any hires are contingent upon successfully clearing a criminal background
check investigation by the UCD Police Department. Positions in IET are
considered to be critical in nature, and the final appointment is
contingent upon the successful completion of a background investigation
within 30 days of hire. We reserve the right to end employment should
the results of a background investigation not be successful. In
addition, student employees are required to be physically present on
campus while working, unless an exemption is granted by management.

In a blog post yesterday, I wrote "Coverage will mainly be on the statistics tutorial, but may also include variants of Quiz questions from this past week."

My policy is always to ask questions only on material from the previous week or earlier.  Last Thursday we got to the middle of the unit on confidence intervals.

Thank you

====================================================================================================Hello Everyone,

Our city and campus community continue to be shaken by violent events
including the fatal attack on Karim Abou Najm - a senior student
majoring in Computer Science
and known to many of you.  There is now understandable fear for
personal safety and that of our loved ones.
We will mourn the deep loss of Karim Abou Najm but first let's make
sure that everyone is safe.

1. Please be vigilant  and follow safety precautions outlined by
university police (see
https://police.ucdavis.edu/education-outreach/safety-tips).

Always be alert to your surroundings.
Try not to travel alone.
Always try to vary your routes to and from work or school.
Be aware of location and situation that will make you vulnerable to
crime, especially in darkness. All the crimes occurred late in the
evening.
Avoid people and situations that make you nervous – Trust Your Instincts!
Stay in well-lighted areas as much as possible.
Walk confidently and at a steady pace, making eye contact with people
when walking.
If you ever feel you or others are in danger, call 911.

2. UC Davis Police Safe Rides program is available to all members of
the UCDavis community (Use UC Davis Police Safe Rides after-hours on
campus by calling
530-754-COPS).

3. I am looking to the College  and Central Administration for
policies and I will pass them along as I  receive them.

Finally, in these difficult times please continue to be kind and
understanding to each other.

I will be monitoring my email closely so let me know if you want to
meet/talk with me.

Take care.

Dear Student:
	
Our records indicate that you enrolled or waitlisted for Spring Quarter 2023 in the following course:
	
	ECS 154A	Computer Architecture
	
You have not satisfied the prerequisite requirement(s) for this course and there is no prerequisite petition on file.  As a result, you have been dropped from this course.
	
Reviewer comments:
	The student has not completed ECS 50 with a passing grade. They need to repeat ECS 50 before taking ECS 154A. 

If you need assistance finding another course to take this term, please contact your advisor.
	
For more information about prerequisite checking, go to https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/registration/schedule/prerequisites.
	
Please contact the instructor of the course if you have questions about the decision to drop you from this course.
	
Sincerely,
Office of the University Registrar


====================================================================================================
Hi, everyone.

You are receiving this message because you are either enrolled or on the waiting list for ECS 132, Spring 2023.

As noted in the course FAQs, this IS a math course, and the math prereqs are vital.  One of those prereqs is linear algebra, and I have a review for you at

https://github.com/matloff/fastLinearAlgebra

Lessons 1-5 is all you will need for this class.

Note that as mentioned yesterday, one of the goals of Quiz 0, which will essentially be a take-home exam due the second week of class, will be to make sure you're ready to USE linear algebra in probability/statistical contexts.

I'm enclosing yesterday's message below.

Norm

**********************************************************************

1.  If you have not already done so, please make sure to read the FAQs for the course,

https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/blob/master/FAQs.md

If you have already read it, please note that I added an item about reading at the end, and that I have clarified the math link a bit.

2.  As explained in the FAQs, we will have weekly quizzes, in-class, using the OMSI tool.  However, THE FIRST QUIZ, Quiz 0, will essentially be take-home.  Note the following:

a.  The purpose of Quiz 0 will be to get you used to OMSI, get up to speed on the R language, and review linear algebra.  See the FAQs for the link to the R tutorial (easy, designed for non-CS people).  I am also preparing a linear algebra tutorial, to be announced soon, but unlike the R case, this is intended as review, not new material.

b.  Quiz 0 will be posted sometime in the next couple of days, to give you a chance to get a head start on the course if you wish.  It will be due sometime in Week 2 of Spring.  We will start running the OMSI server in Week 1.

3.  Our textbook will be a subset of the PDF file at

https://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/ProbStatBook.pdf

We will cover about 60-70% of that material.  I will post the exact trimmed version of this file in the next few days.

Looking forward to working with you.

Hi, everyone.

You are receiving this message because you are either enrolled or on the waiting list for ECS 132, Spring 2023.

1.  If you have not already done so, please make sure to read the FAQs for the course,

https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/blob/master/FAQs.md

If you have already read it, please note that I added an item about reading at the end, and that I have clarified the math link a bit.

2.  As explained in the FAQs, we will have weekly quizzes, in-class, using the OMSI tool.  However, THE FIRST QUIZ, Quiz 0, will essentially be take-home.  Note the following:

a.  The purpose of Quiz 0 will be to get you used to OMSI, get up to speed on the R language, and review linear algebra.  See the FAQs for the link to the R tutorial (easy, designed for non-CS people).  I am also preparing a linear algebra tutorial, to be announced soon, but unlike the R case, this is intended as review, not new material.

b.  Quiz 0 will be posted sometime in the next couple of days, to give you a chance to get a head start on the course if you wish.  It will be due sometime in Week 2 of Spring.  We will start running the OMSI server in Week 1.

3.  Our textbook will be a subset of the PDF file at

https://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/ProbStatBook.pdf

We will cover about 60-70% of that material.  I will post the exact trimmed version of this file in the next few days.

Looking forward to working with you.

Norm Matloff

Download it to your laptop computer.  You will need it there for all quizzes other than Quiz 0.  

This version is less than half the size of the full book, which is at

We will cover the entirety of this reduced version.

2.  After I posted Quiz 0 yesterday, I added a paragraph regarding use of R libraries that are not in base-R.  Make sure to keep this in mind, to avoid situations in which you fail to get credit on a quiz question even though your code correctly uses certain libraries.

Kevin (grad student in my group) needs to make a new part for some X-ray 
scattering measurements and doesn't know CAD. I instantly thought 
ChemECAD could save him. Is there someone able to work with him today, 
over the weekend, but has to be done on Monday or else Kevin is in deep 
trouble.

Thanks

====================================================================================================Hi, Evan. 

Unless you have a medical/technical reason, that would not be fair to other students in the class. It’s good that you submitted what you have — your TAs are fairly generous in grading and give partial credit for attempts in the right direction. And remember to start early in the week next time, and come talk to me/TAs/tutors during office hours and we are happy to help you complete the HW.

====================================================================================================Hi Evan Tan,

Your CourseAssist AI account has been created for ECS 150! 

CourseAssist AI is a LLM-powered course assistant that can answer your questions related to ECS 150. It has knowledge about your lecture slides, as well as any information your instructor provides. You may ask it to explain ideas step-by-step. Since all answers are generated by a LLM, use with caution as LLMs are known to hallucinate and make up facts. If you use CourseAssist for any of your homework assignments, be sure to follow LLM usage policies, if any, set by your instructor. 

Do not use CourseAssist to generate code solutions directly, as it may generate misleading or suboptimal code. Rather, use it as a learning aid and ask it to explain concepts. 

For any questions related to course policies, logistics, and rules, please direct them to your instructor, as CourseAssist only has access to course content like lecture slides/notes and cannot make decisions that require human judgement.

Note that CourseAssist is an early stage prototype and it may have bugs. Let us know if you encounter any issues or have any comments or suggestions. We would love to hear your feedback!

You can now log in to CourseAssist AI https://u40698754.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=eA6md-2Bv0pDNsrLJOfubbEC3U5m0BbzzEfUuqkf4NRtZXI9zkmzAFjuW0WUaWRDUPNW6R_TTa87GMsyhOhEeg1I3re0my2l9TXHrO5aG5ga6QOpV94YtI8jV2rJaJfcbkFi1o1VHNvZXrPsLiH6RSnTj-2Fu11z-2FhplkQCveF45uGU8JgeF7hqtKpohqwbbHGVMHNkX5xDvMNq6kt4YzqkrkZAW0cLDA-2BMjx0EBmo9MvuqWSqJZejMMGYD6jXECJXfGfjqKqBljwmrESIuH-2Fk6voXmnFpg-3D-3D using your email and your temporary password below.

====================================================================================================To UC Davis Academics, students and staff -

As campus prepares for the University of California's COVID-19 vaccine mandate - due to take effect July 15 - all employees and students are required to declare one of the following:

 * I am fully vaccinated
 * I plan to get fully vaccinated
 * I plan to request a medical exemption
 * I plan to request a religious belief exception
 * I never work on campus or around others and do not intend to be vaccinated

Go to the "Surveys" section within Health-e-Messaging, and complete the "COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate," containing the five options listed above. 

This survey form must be completed by July 15, including those who have already verified your vaccine information in the Health-e-Messaging portal. Please note that the submission process for medical exemption and religious belief exception is still being finalized. If you selected either of these options, you will receive more information about the process in the coming weeks.

If you are vaccinated and you wish to authorize the university to confidentially verify this information with the California Immunization Registry, you may do so by completing the "COVID-19 Vaccine Verification Authorization" form in the "Medical Clearances" section of Health-e-Messaging. 

**Please note that UC Davis Health employees have a separate vaccination verification process for access to UCDH facilities. Some employees may be required to verify their vaccine status in both systems. 

Looking for an easy way to get vaccinated on campus? We're looking for volunteers to join our standby list when we have extra doses available. Text "DavisVax" to 888777 for text alerts from UC Davis about our vaccine clinic.

For more information about the UC Davis Vaccine Program, go to campusready.ucdavis.edu/covid-vaccination.

We are Jiji and Huryoung and we are the Asian Pacific Culture Week
Coordinators (APCW) for the UC Davis Cross Cultural Center. You may have
formerly known this celebration as the Asian Pacific Islander Community Night
Market (APCNM), an annual day-long event consisting of vendors, arts, crafts,
foods, and performances from both students and professional groups.

This year, APCW will be different as we kick off the first week of Asian
Pacific Heritage Month (May 3-8, 2021) with a variety of virtual programs that
will lead up to our main event on May 8, 2021, titled Lockdown Sessions: API
Represent. During this week, our community will share experiences, dive into
passions, and spark connections via discussions surrounding culture, home, and
identity within the Asian Pacific diaspora. We will share the list of programs
for APCW as our week comes closer, so be on the lookout for that.

Lockdown Sessions: API Represent is the Cross Cultural Center’s collaboration
with KDVS 90.3 FM. Here, we will be showcasing different API student talents
and acts via Twitch livestream. We are asking the community for 2-4 minute
video submissions that display any expressive medium that you feel is relevant
to API representation. This includes but is not limited to spoken word,
singing, dancing, videography, DJ sets etc. This is a great opportunity to
highlight amazing API talent and to build community! We are excited to share
space and time with you all during the event. Space is limited, so please sign
up as soon as possible.

The deadline to submit your videos will be on Sunday, April 25th by 11:59 PM
PST.

HOW TO SUBMIT
Sign up on the google form  LOCKDOWN SESSIONS: API Represent!
Submit 2-3 minute video to ucd.apcn@gmail.com

Name/Pronouns/Year in the email

Time: 7pm (10th April, Saturday, Davis time) ; 10am (11th April Sunday,

MYSO was initially created to help provide an environment and a group for

This might be our last year as a club, so we would love to be able to get all
the Malaysians together and we are also open to others who want to learn about
Malaysian Students in Davis who are interested as well!

====================================================================================================Hi Evan,

I'll provide solutions for the written homework. Some students added

====================================================================================================Hello Evan,

Sorry that I didn't respond sooner, but I did not have internet for all 
of Monday.

No, they don't include three academic articles. Those would need to be 
in established journals, and the only ones I see among your references 
are the ones by Keating and Østergaard.

You should cite a PDF using the same format for web pages, since this is 
an online resource.

Finally, I would recommend in the future that you contact the professor 
about assignments before the day they are due, particularly when the 
deadline is known to you since the first day of class.

Regards,

Jeremy Mason

====================================================================================================Evan,
You have a choice of using your AP score or taking MAT 16A, 17A, or 21A. If you were to choose to take our MAT 16A, 17A or 21A then you will need to take the Math Placement Exam. If you choose to use your AP score for those classes, then you do not need to take the Math Placement Exam. Sometimes folks want a nice easy transition to college so taking a refresher course in Calculus helps.


As for chemistry you should speak to their department.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering.====================================================================================================Dear Mr. Tan,

I am glad that you found that you have access to the text and homework.

As I understand it, you need to buy equitable access for all three 
quarters, or buy the same access from Cengage directly.  I gather, 
indirectly from other student comments, that they have slightly lower 
prices for longer access periods.  It is almost certain that you will 
use the same text and OWL homework for 2B and 2C.  Equitable Access for 
those quarters will provide it, but at a renewed cost, as I understand it.

Best regards,

Prof. McCurdy

====================================================================================================You should have already received an informational email regarding the Chemistry Placement Exam. For the purpose of this message, we are letting you know that you have been automatically registered to take the Chemistry Placement Exam.

If you are planning to enroll in general chemistry, all students must earn a qualifying score from the Chemistry Placement Exam. For CHE 2A (General Chemistry), students must earn a score of 24+. For CHE 2AH (Honors General Chemistry), a score of 33+ must be earned. Scores earned from the Chemistry Placement Exam are sent via email within two (2) business days after the exam is taken. More information about our placement requirements and the Chemistry Placement Exam can be found on our website (https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/general-chemistry-series/chemistry-placement-requirements/fall-2019).

The time slot selected for you is based upon your major and the college it is housed. You can take the Chemistry Placement Exam online during this time frame:

     You have automatically been registered for this exam.
     Exam time for students in the College of Engineering
     May 18, 11 AM until May 25, 11 AM

Instructions and a link to the exam are available at http://placement.chem.ucdavis.edu/instructions/.

The email address we have on file for you is: ettan@ucdavis.edu

When prompted for your username or proctor username for the exam, you should enter: ettan

 Your password is your UC Davis student ID number, with no symbols or spaces between the numbers.

If you miss your designated testing session for your college's orientation, you will have to wait until the Fall testing sessions open later in the Summer. For those dates, please reference our website (https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/general-chemistry-series/chemistry-placement-requirements/fall-2019).  You will still be able to register for classes, including CHE 2A if applicable, but you will need to have passed the placement exam with a qualifying score before the first day of Fall Quarter.  We strongly recommend that you contact your major/college advisor to review your incoming study plan. This way, they have a chance to comment and ensure that you are registered for the correct set of classes in the Fall.

How can you prepare for the Chemistry Placement Exam? You are welcome to study on your own by reviewing high-school chemistry concepts. Any "Introduction to Chemistry" text would be good for review. You may also find our Chemistry LibreTexts webpage helpful (https://chem.libretexts.org/).

Hello,

I am an incoming freshman and majoring in chemical engineering. Do I still
have to take the math placement exams even if I got a 5 in AB and assuming
I get one too in BC? Also, do I have to take the chemistry placement exam
since I got a 4 in AP Chemistry?

Thanks,
Evan

I am open to communicate through discord. I am also open to just texting as well. My phone number is 209-857-6426. It seems like most if not all of us is usually free Friday and Saturday so maybe we can chat through discord on those days.

Nice to meet you all! I'm Surabhi. I thought that it might be of use
to have a way to communicate outside of Canvas. What would you guys
prefer? My proposal is Discord.
